#### Credits
##### This EDK2 port is based on my previous work on EDK2 for lavender, which is based on Danct12's intial work on Redmi Note 7 [lavender](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/edk2-lavender)
which is based on fxsheep's [Mi6 port](https://github.com/fxsheep/edk2-sagit/), which is based on zhuowei's [edk2-pixel3](https://github.com/Pixel3Dev/edk2-pixel3)
